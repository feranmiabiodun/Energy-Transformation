### Sustainable Energy Transformation

#### Introduction
In this project, I had the privilege of leading a dynamic team in a project of national significance â€“ ensuring a sustainable electricity supply in Spain. Our mission was to bridge the gap between renewable and fossil fuel energy sources, using data-driven insights. Through thorough analysis and modeling, our team achieved the top position on the leaderboard, showcasing the power of data science in shaping a sustainable energy future. Our project emphasized the real-world impact of data-driven decisions and underscored the critical role of renewables in Spain's energy landscape. It was a journey of both professional growth and meaningful change.

#### Objective
Our primary objective was to model the daily shortfall between energy generated from fossil fuels and various renewable sources in Spain. This shortfall, referred to as the target variable, was predicted based on city-specific weather features such as pressure, wind speed, humidity, and more, in relation to energy consumption and production.

#### My Role

My contributions to this project include:

- Leading a dynamic team to bridge the gap between renewable and fossil fuel energy sources using data-driven insights.
- Overseeing in-depth data analysis and working closely with modeling, which led our team to achieve the top position on the leaderboard.
- Guiding the project to both professional growth and meaningful change.

#### Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of our model, we used the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric, which measures the standard deviation of the residuals between predicted and actual observed values.

#### Conclusion
This project not only highlighted the importance of sustainable energy transformation but also demonstrated how data science can drive meaningful change. It was a privilege to lead a team in shaping the future of Spain's energy landscape through data-driven decisions.
